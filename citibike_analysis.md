Citi Bike is a very profitable business in New York City, with a total of 2,344,224 records 
for the month of August only. Des Moines is a far smaller city, with a population more than 40 times 
smaller, but it's still comparable with a similar gender diversity, and a vast amount of tourists 
(35 to 1 in Des Moines, compared to 8 to 14 in NYC). Citi Bike can be profitable in Des Moines too 
with a high ratio of Customers/Suscribers. As tourist attractions and business districts are spreaded 
over Greater Des Moines (compareed to Mahattan in NYC), the stations and the bikes will be spreaded,
and not concentrated downtown, as well.

## NYC August Citi Bikes
The number of records is 2,344,224 in August. 
        - 1,530,272 - male
        - 588,431 - female
        - 225,521 - gender unknown

## NYC/Des Moines Population
NYC: 8,336,817
DM: 214,237    

## NYC/DM Gender Comparison
NYC: 52.3%
DM: 50.8%
Similar Breakdown. So we can anticipate that the trends following any new business relatively to gender diversity will be similar in NYC and Des Moines. Most suscribers are residents so this part of the business could follow similar trends.

## NYC August Peak Hours
In general (combining both Customers and suscribers), we can see that most of the recoprds hapen during the day, so all maintenace and repairs work should happen during the night, between 1am and 5am.
Suscribers trends follow business hours, so the records peak between 7am and 9am, and between 4pm and 7pm., whereas Customers records peak between 11am and 7pm.

## NYC Customers vs Suscribers
Even if there are fewer trips made by Customers in NYC (ratio of 4,25 suscriber to customer), these ones last far longer averaging 2,040 to 819 for Suscribers. When we sum all the trip duration, the ratio is down to 1.8.

## NYC/DM Tourists Comparison
NYC gets more 67 Milliuon tourists in one year, which is a ratio of approximatively 8 tourits per resident.
Des Moines gets 13.7 million tourists in one year, which is a ratio of approximatively 60 tourits per resident.
The tourists, using the bike rental system, will mostly be Customers, whereas the Suscribers are mostly residents. DSo we can expect a higher ratio of Customers to Suswcribers in Des Moines than in NYC.

## NYC McDonalds Density
The McDonals densituy is always interesting to look at because they always follow the trends of active population density. In NYC, they are mostly located by Manhattan.

## NYC Top Starting Locations
The Top Starting Locations, where most bikes are geting rented, are located by Manhattan, where mnost tourits attractions and business districts are located.

## DM McDonalds Density
There's no concentration anywhere, they are well spreade4d all over Greater Des Moines, like the tourist attractions and the business districts. So the rental stations should be spreaded all over as well, with a similar number of bikes, to start with.
